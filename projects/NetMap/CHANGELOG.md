## [Unreleased]

### Added - Iteration 5: Async Discovery
- Discovery job manager: one background job per network, single active job per process
- `POST /api/v1/discovery/start`, `GET /api/v1/discovery/status`, `GET /api/v1/discovery/results`, `POST /api/v1/discovery/cancel`
- Live progress tracking (monotonic percentage, `scanned_hosts` counters)
- ICMP probe (raw socket, `CAP_NET_RAW`) with automatic TCP fallback
- Discovery range limits: `DISCOVERY_MAX_HOSTS` (default 1024), `InvalidCIDRError` / `NetworkTooLargeError`
- Discovery UI with live progress polling, results and cancel
- Real-world validation on 192.168.80.0/24: 254 scanned, 12 discovered, repeat run without duplicates, cancel works

### Added - Iteration 4: Connections and Topology
- Connections API hardening: validation, duplicate protection, filters, pagination
- Connections duplicate protection (`409 Conflict`) with unique endpoint constraint
- Connections API validation (`400`/`404`) for devices, ports, interfaces and connection types
- Connections API filters (`device_id`, `is_active`, `connection_type`) and pagination (`page`, `per_page`)
- Topology API `GET /api/v1/topology` backed by TopologyService
- Topology nodes (devices with interfaces/IPs/ports) and edges (real connections only)
- Topology filters (`network_id`, `device_type`, `status`)
- Connections UI: device filter, interface+port labels, IP display, Open in Topology
- Topology visualization rebuilt on `GET /api/v1/topology` (Cytoscape.js, directed edges, labels, empty state)
- Documentation: Iteration 4 added to PROJECT_STATUS, TODO, API spec

### Changed
- TCP fallback ports unified into a single source of truth (`FALLBACK_TCP_PORTS` in `network_scanner`, shared with monitoring)
- Documentation: Iteration 5 sync for API spec, PROJECT_STATUS, TODO, CHANGELOG

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added - Iteration 3: Monitoring Engine
- MonitoringService for device availability checks
- APScheduler integration for background periodic tasks
- Automatic device reachability monitoring (ICMP ping + TCP fallback)
- Configurable monitoring interval (default: 5 minutes)
- Monitoring enable/disable via `MONITORING_ENABLED` config
- Primary IP selection logic (prefer `is_primary`, fallback to any IP)
- TCP fallback to device's known open ports or standard ports
- Reloader-safe scheduler initialization (Flask debug mode compatible)
- Auto-update `Device.is_active` based on monitoring results

### Added - UI/UX Polish
- Device Types: LXC, VM, ZigBee with custom labels
- Device Type labels mapping (LXC → "LXC", VM → "VM", ZigBee → "ZigBee")
- Port Import API endpoint `POST /api/v1/imports/ports` (implemented, not committed)
- Bulk port import service with duplicate prevention
- Standard service detection and automatic naming
- Auto-marker for imported ports (`description='import:auto'`)

### Changed
- Terminology: "Ports" → "Services" in UI (Device cards, Dashboard, Details page)
- Device cards: Full Services list on separate lines (no truncation, no scrollbar)
- Device cards: Auto-height based on Services count
- Device cards: Removed Interfaces preview block
- Device cards: Horizontal counters layout (Interfaces | IPs | Services | Links)
- Device cards: 3-column grid on desktop (row-cols-xl-3)
- Services display: Service name bold, port/protocol normal, Open button right-aligned
- Services display: Thin dividers between rows
- Device form: Device Type dropdown with display labels
- Config: Added `MONITORING_ENABLED` and `MONITORING_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
- Requirements: Added APScheduler dependency

### Fixed
- Device cards now show all Services without +N more button
- Device cards grid layout consistency (h-100 for equal heights in row)
- Hostname/IP display logic (show both if hostname exists, IP only otherwise)
