# NetMap REST API
**Version:** 1.1
**Status:** Current Implementation
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-17
**Document:** 03_API.md

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the REST API specification for NetMap.

The API is the single interface between:

- Web UI
- Mobile clients (future)
- CLI tools
- External integrations
- Automation

All application logic must be exposed through the API.

The frontend never accesses the database directly.

**Current Implementation — API-side filtering/sorting/pagination:**

**Query Parameters:**

- `search=<term>` — Search by name, hostname, or IP address
- `network_id=<id>` — Filter by network
- `device_type=<type>` — Filter by device type (router, switch, server, lxc, vm, etc.)
- `is_active=<true|false>` — Filter by active status (availability monitoring updates this field)
- `status=<active|inactive>` — Alias for is_active filter
- `links=<with|without>` — Filter by connection presence
- `sort=<field>` — Sort by field: id, name, display_name, hostname, device_type, is_active, created_at, updated_at
- `order=<asc|desc>` — Sort order (default: asc)
- `page=<n>` — Page number (default: 1)
- `per_page=<n>` — Results per page (default: 50, max: 500)

**Examples:**

```
GET /devices?page=1&per_page=50
GET /devices?is_active=true
GET /devices?network_id=2
GET /devices?device_type=server
GET /devices?search=proxmox
GET /devices?sort=hostname&page=2
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "devices": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 50,
    "total": 41,
    "pages": 1
  }
}
```

---

GET /devices/{id}

Returns device details with relationships (network, interfaces, ip_addresses, ports, connections).

---

POST /devices

Create a new device.

---

PUT /devices/{id}

Update device.

---

DELETE /devices/{id}

Delete device (cascades to interfaces, ports, connections).

# 16. Connections

GET

/connections

Return device connections.

**Current Implementation — validation, duplicate protection, filters, pagination:**

**Query Parameters:**

- `device_id=<id>` — Filter by device (connection is returned when the device is the source or the target)
- `is_active=<true|false>` — Filter by active status
- `connection_type=<type>` — Filter by type (network, ethernet, fiber, wifi, virtual, other)
- `page=<n>` — Page number (default: 1)
- `per_page=<n>` — Results per page (default: 50, max: 500; alias `page_size`)

**Backward compatibility:** a request with no query parameters at all returns a bare JSON array of all connections (legacy behavior). Any query parameter switches to the paginated envelope:

```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 50,
  "total": 12,
  "total_pages": 1
}
```

---

GET

/connections/{id}

Return one connection.

---

POST

/connections

Create a connection between two devices.

Request example

```json
{
  "source_device_id": 1,
  "target_device_id": 3,
  "connection_type": "ethernet",
  "source_interface_id": 5,
  "target_interface_id": 7,
  "source_port_id": 10,
  "target_port_id": 12,
  "description": "Backbone link",
  "is_active": true
}
```

**Validation (400 Bad Request):**

- JSON body is required
- `source_device_id` and `target_device_id` are required
- Source and target devices must differ
- `connection_type` must be one of: network, ethernet, fiber, wifi, virtual, other (default: network)
- Ports and interfaces must belong to their respective device
- Source and target interfaces must differ

**Validation (404 Not Found):**

- Source or target device does not exist
- Referenced port or interface does not exist

**Duplicate protection (409 Conflict):**

A connection is considered a duplicate when the device pair plus the optional interface/port endpoints match an existing connection. `connection_type` is deliberately not part of the identity, so the same physical link cannot be recorded twice under different types. Duplicates are rejected with `409 Conflict` ("Connection already exists"). A database unique constraint on the endpoint pair enforces the same rule at the schema level.

---

PUT

/connections/{id}

Update a connection. Accepts any subset of the connection fields; every referenced device, port and interface is validated and the duplicate check is re-run excluding the updated connection.

---

DELETE

/connections/{id}

Delete a connection.

Connection fields

- `source_device_id` — required
- `target_device_id` — required
- `connection_type` — network, ethernet, fiber, wifi, virtual, other
- `source_interface_id` / `target_interface_id` — optional
- `source_port_id` / `target_port_id` — optional
- `description`
- `is_active`

Deleting a device also removes its associated connections (cascade).

---

# 17. Topology

GET

/topology

Return the device/connection graph consumed by the `/topology` page.

**Current Implementation:**

Response shape:

```json
{
  "nodes": [...],
  "edges": [...]
}
```

**Nodes** are devices. Each node `data` block contains:

- `id` — `"device-{id}"`
- `deviceId` — numeric device id
- `label` — `display_name` or `name`
- `isActive` — boolean
- `linked` — true when the device has at least one connection inside the filtered node set
- `device` — full device record
- `interfaces` — interfaces, each with its nested `ip_addresses`
- `ports` — ports

**Edges** are derived strictly from existing Connection records — no synthetic links are ever fabricated, and every connection maps to exactly one edge. An edge is included only when both endpoints are part of the filtered node set. Each edge `data` block contains:

- `id` — `"conn-{id}"`
- `source` / `target` — `"device-{id}"` node references
- `type` — connection type
- `label` — interface-based label (e.g. `eth0 → eth1`); generic interface names are rendered as `iface {id}`
- `connection` — full connection record (source/target device, interface and port ids)

**Query Parameters:**

- `network_id=<id>` — Include devices of a single network
- `device_type=<type>` — Include devices with the exact device type
- `status=<active|inactive>` — Filter by device active status

**Note:** the server edge `label` is interface-based only. The client (`static/js/topology.js`) builds the final label, adding the port when available (e.g. `eth0 · 80/tcp (HTTP) → eth0 · 80/tcp (HTTP)`).

---

# 18. Discovery

Discovery is an **asynchronous background job** (current implementation).
Only one job may run at a time per process; job state is kept in memory
and is not persisted between restarts.

**Job statuses:** `running`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed`
**Phases:** `scanning`, `syncing`, `done`, `cancelled`

**Common job response shape** (returned by `start`, `status` and `cancel`):

```json
{
  "network_id": 1,
  "status": "completed",
  "phase": "done",
  "started_at": "2026-08-17T10:00:00.000000",
  "finished_at": "2026-08-17T10:00:25.123456",
  "error": null,
  "total_hosts": 254,
  "scanned_hosts": 254,
  "hosts_found": 12,
  "devices_synced": 12,
  "discovered": 12,
  "progress": 100,
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "docker.local",
      "hostname": "docker.local",
      "device_type": "unknown"
    }
  ]
}
```

`progress` is a monotonic completion percentage in `0..100`.

---

POST /api/v1/discovery/start

Start a background discovery job for a network.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "network_id": 1
}
```

**Response (202 Accepted):** the job dict with `status: "running"`.

**Errors:**

- `400` — `network_id` is not an integer, the network is inactive, or the
  network exceeds `DISCOVERY_MAX_HOSTS` (default 1024) hosts
- `404` — network not found
- `409` — another discovery job is already running (conflict)

---

GET /api/v1/discovery/status?network_id=<id>

Return the current job state and progress.

**Errors:**

- `400` — `network_id` query parameter missing
- `404` — no discovery job exists for this network

---

GET /api/v1/discovery/results?network_id=<id>

Return the latest discovery results (job state plus the discovered hosts).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "network_id": 1,
  "status": "completed",
  "total_hosts": 254,
  "scanned_hosts": 254,
  "discovered": 12,
  "progress": 100,
  "results": [
    {
      "ip_address": "192.168.80.16",
      "hostname": "docker.local",
      "open_ports": [22, 80, 443],
      "reachable": true,
      "device_id": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

`device_id` is populated after the sync phase completes (`null` while scanning).

**Errors:**

- `400` — `network_id` query parameter missing
- `404` — no discovery job exists for this network

---

POST /api/v1/discovery/cancel

Request cancellation of a running job. Cancelling an already finished job
is idempotent (the job is returned unchanged).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "network_id": 1
}
```

**Response:** the job dict with `status: "cancelled"`.

**Errors:**

- `400` — `network_id` is not an integer
- `404` — no discovery job exists for this network

---

POST /api/v1/networks/{id}/discover

Legacy synchronous discovery (blocking request). Kept for backward
compatibility; the async endpoints above are the current implementation.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "network_id": 1,
  "cidr": "192.168.80.0/24",
  "hosts_found": 12,
  "devices_synced": 12,
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "docker.local",
      "hostname": "docker.local",
      "device_type": "unknown"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Errors:**

- `400` — network is inactive, or the network exceeds `DISCOVERY_MAX_HOSTS` hosts
- `404` — network not found

---

**Discovery Method:**

- ICMP echo probe (raw socket) as the primary reachability check when the
  process has `CAP_NET_RAW`; automatic TCP fallback otherwise
- TCP port probing (ports: 22, 23, 53, 80, 81, 443, 445, 554, 8080, 8443 —
  single source of truth shared with monitoring)
- DNS hostname resolution
- Open port detection
- Device/Interface/IPAddress/Port creation and synchronization
- Inactive device marking

**Configuration:**

- `DISCOVERY_MAX_HOSTS` — maximum hosts per scan (default: 1024)
- `DISCOVERY_TCP_TIMEOUT` — TCP probe timeout (default: 0.5)
- `DISCOVERY_ICMP_TIMEOUT` — ICMP probe timeout (default: 1.0)
- `DISCOVERY_WORKERS` — probe workers (default: 50)

---

# 19. Monitoring

**Status:** Implemented (background service)

**Current Implementation:**

Monitoring runs automatically in the background via APScheduler. Device availability is checked every 5 minutes (configurable) and `Device.is_active` is updated automatically.

**Configuration:**
- `MONITORING_ENABLED` — Enable/disable monitoring (default: true)
- `MONITORING_INTERVAL_MINUTES` — Check interval in minutes (default: 5)

**Monitoring Logic:**
- ICMP ping (primary method)
- TCP probe to known open ports (fallback)
- Updates `Device.is_active` field

**Planned Endpoints:**

GET /monitoring/status — Get monitoring service status

GET /monitoring/history — Get monitoring check history

POST /monitoring/check — Trigger immediate check for specific device

GET /monitoring/stats — Get monitoring statistics

# 31. API Philosophy

The API is the public interface of NetMap.

Every feature must be available through the API.

The Web UI is only a client of the REST API.

Business logic belongs to Services.

Database access belongs to Repositories.

The API must remain stable and backward compatible.
